    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by. I&apos;m a software engineer and technology
      consultant from India. Hailing from a tranquil, sleepy village named
      Velloor, I live in Trivandrum now.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science, I had a
      short stint working as web application engineer at SupplyAI. Later I
      pursued Master&apos;s degree in Information Security. During that time, I
      worked on some freelance web projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the love for building great digital products, I co-founded
      Firstbyte in November 2017. I find excitement in leveraging technology to
      solve business problems.
